# Contributing Guidelines

We gladly accept contributions.  Before submitting a pull request, we strongly suggest filing an issue in this repository.  This will allow us to first evaluate the problem, as well as discuss potential solutions.

Once you're ready to submit a pull request, you'll notice we automatically run our tests and build using AppVeyor.  This build must pass before being eligible to merge.

You'll also notice an automated Contributor License Agreenment bot runs.  You must accepts the terms of the CLA before the build is eligible to merge.
